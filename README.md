# Sleep Quality and Short Term Memory
This repos is the documentation of codes to manage dataset, analyze and build model of machine learning based on the dataset.

## Dataset
Dataset on this work was gained using PSQI procedure and Memory Test to recognize the short-term memory of each research subject.

## Analysist
The analysis was conducted to gained an insight how Sleep Quality and Short-term memory correlated each other, in order to maintain a robust dataset and avoiding any bias occur.

## Machine Learning Model
